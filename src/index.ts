// want in a real library:
//
// - There's no run-length encoding (well, outside the causal-graph library).
//   All operations are split into individual insert / deletes.
// - When we replay operations, *all* operations are processed in full. A
//   better library will skip updating the CRDT when operations are fully ordered.
// - The causal graph is traversed naively

// I say there's no run-length encoding. But because I'm a bit lazy, I'm reusing
// the fancier causal graph implementation that I've made for other projects. This
// CG implementation internally run-length encodes the causal graph in memory.
//
// The causal graph library is used for its graph manipulation helper functions -
// like diff and iterVersionsBetween.

 * This function is called when we process insert operations to find (via a scan) the

 *
 * Some history:
 *
 * This algorithm started its life in Yjs, written by Kevin Jahns. I adapted that approach
 * for reference-crdts. Then modified & improved it in place to make YjsMod. Then the
 * algorithm was improved further by Matthew Weidner to make Fugue. The fugue paper
 * proves many nice properties about this algorithm and its interleaving behaviour:
 *
 * https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583
 *
 * Finally, I've replaced rightOrigin in fugue-list's items implementation with rightParent.
 * (Calculated before integrate is called). Ordinarily this would result in correct behaviour
 * but pathological performance in the integrate method because rightOrigin is also used in
 * fugue-list to bound the search for insert location. But, here its easy to simply calculate
 * rightBound as items are inserted.
 *
 * Meanwhile, Greg Little and Michael Toomim wrote a separate sequence CRDT algorithm called
 * Sync9. Sync9 predated fugue by a couple of years. It was formulated a different way (using
 * trees), but it turns out the ordering behaviour between sync9 and fugue is identical.
 *
 * Anyway, the long and short of it is: This function implements the Sync9 / Fugue CRDT.
